                                <h3>Early Life and Education:</h3>
                                <p>Born on 11 December in 1843 in Glausthal, Germany, Robert Koch was a childhood prodigy.
                                    He taught himself to read newspapers when he was only 5. He loved to read classical
                                    literature and was a chess expert. He gained an interest in science while in high
                                    school, and decided to study biology. Koch acquired his medical degree from the
                                    University of Göttingen, Germany in 1866.</p>
    
                                <h3>Contributions and Achievements:</h3>
                                <p>Koch developed a strong interest in pathology and infectious diseases as a medical
                                    student. After working as a physician in many small towns throughout Germany, he
                                    volunteered as a military surgeon during the Franco-Prussian war (1870-72). He was
                                    appointed a district medical officer for Wollstein after the war.</p>
    
                                <p>His main duty as a medical officer was investigating the spread of infectious bacterial
                                    diseases. Koch was very much interested in the transmission of anthrax from cattle to
                                    humans. Not very happy with the prevailing process of confirming the cause of infectious
                                    disease, Koch formulated four criteria in 1890 that must be achieved for establishing a
                                    cause of an infectious disease. These rules were termed as “Koch’s postulates” or
                                    “Henle-Koch postulates”. German pathologist Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle was a
                                    collaborator in Koch’s research.</p>
    
                                <h3>Later Life and Death:</h3>
                                <p>Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. The medical applications of biotechnology still
                                    heavily depend on the Koch’s principles of affirming the causes of infectious diseases.
                                    Koch died on 27 May in 1910 in Black Forest region of Germany. He was 66 years old.</p>
